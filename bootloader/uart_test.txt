  Minimal ARM Bootloader v1.0
  QEMU raspi3b / Real Hardware
========================================

Subsystem Initialization:
  [OK] UART   - Serial communication
  [OK] Timer  - System timing
  [OK] GPIO   - I/O control
  [OK] Memory - Heap allocator
  [OK] Mailbox - VideoCore interface

Storage Subsystem:
  [OK] SD card initialized
  [OK] FAT filesystem mounted
  [INFO] kernel8.img not found (OK for testing)

Memory Test:
  [FAIL] Memory allocation failed

GPIO Test:
  [OK] LED pin configured as output
  [OK] LED control test complete

Boot completed in 725 milliseconds

========================================
  BOOT SUCCESSFUL
========================================

Bootloader Features:
  [OK] UART serial communication
  [OK] System timer and delays
  [OK] GPIO pin control
  [OK] Dynamic memory allocation
  [OK] VideoCore mailbox interface
  [OK] SD card EMMC driver
  [OK] FAT32 filesystem support

On real hardware:
  - Insert FAT32 formatted SD card
  - Place kernel8.img in root directory
  - Bootloader will load and execute kernel

In QEMU:
  - SD/EMMC emulation limited
  - Core bootloader features validated
  - Ready for real hardware deployment

Entering idle loop...

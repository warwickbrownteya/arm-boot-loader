## II. Platform Support

### Emulation Platforms
| Platform | Boot Success | Subsystems Working | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| QEMU virt | ✅ VERIFIED | UART, Timer, Memory | Recommended test platform |
| QEMU raspi3b | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Requires firmware | CPU doesn't start without GPU firmware |
| QEMU raspi4b | 🔬 UNTESTED | Unknown | Not attempted |

### Physical Hardware
| Model | Boot Attempted | Boot Success | Issues Identified |
|-------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Raspberry Pi 4B | ✅ YES | ❌ NO | No UART output, no boot progression |
| Raspberry Pi 3B | ❌ NO | 🔬 UNTESTED | Not attempted |
| Raspberry Pi Zero 2W | ❌ NO | 🔬 UNTESTED | Not attempted |
| Raspberry Pi 5 | ❌ NO | 🔬 UNTESTED | Not attempted |

**Physical Hardware Success Rate**: 0/1 (0%)

### Root Cause Analysis: Pi 4B Boot Failure
**Hypothesis**:
1. Missing GPU firmware files (bootcode.bin, start4.elf, fixup4.dat)
2. Incorrect file naming (needs kernel8.img, not bootloader.bin)
3. Missing config.txt configuration
4. Possible memory layout issues
5. Possible UART pin configuration errors

**Status**: Diagnosed but not yet fixed

## V. Formal Verification

### Mathematical Frameworks
| Framework | Implementation Status | Verification Status |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| FSA (44 states) | ✅ DOCUMENTED | 🔬 NOT RUN |
| Tarski model theory | ✅ DOCUMENTED | 🔬 NOT RUN |
| Grothendieck categories | ✅ DOCUMENTED | 🔬 NOT RUN |
| Kripke semantics | ✅ DOCUMENTED | 🔬 NOT RUN |
| Gödel theory | ✅ DOCUMENTED | 🔬 NOT RUN |
| Scott domains | ✅ DOCUMENTED | 🔬 NOT RUN |

### Ontology Specifications
| Ontology File | Status | Validated |
|---------------|--------|-----------|
| arm_boot_integrated_fsa.n3 | ✅ EXISTS | 🔬 UNTESTED |
| rpi_bsp_requirements.n3 | ✅ EXISTS | 🔬 UNTESTED |
| 33+ other ontology files | ✅ EXISTS | 🔬 UNTESTED |

**Reality Check**: Formal verification is documented but not executed. Mathematical frameworks are theoretical until validated with proof checkers.

---

## VI. Documentation

### Completeness
| Document Type | Count | Quality Assessment |
|---------------|-------|-------------------|
| README | 1 | ⚠️ Comprehensive but optimistic about status |
| Technical guides | 28+ | ℹ️ AI-generated, not validated against implementation |
| API documentation | Inline | ⚠️ Comments exist but may not match behavior |
| Build instructions | 1 | ✅ Accurate for QEMU |
| Hardware setup | 1 | 🔬 UNTESTED on real hardware |

### Accuracy Issues
- Documentation claims "Production Ready" - **FALSE**, hardware boot fails
- Claims "60% test coverage" - **UNVERIFIED**, no coverage reports run
- Claims "Full Raspberry Pi Support" - **MISLEADING**, only QEMU tested
- FSA verification claimed - **NOT EXECUTED**, only documented

---

## VII. Known Issues (Critical Honesty)

### Blockers
1. **Physical Hardware Boot Fails** (Severity: CRITICAL)
   - Status: Diagnosed, not fixed
   - Impact: Cannot deploy to real Raspberry Pi
   - Estimated fix: Requires SD card setup with firmware

2. **SD Card Driver Non-Functional** (Severity: HIGH)
   - Status: Fails in QEMU, untested on hardware
   - Impact: Cannot load kernels from storage
   - Root cause: QEMU EMMC emulation incomplete

3. **No Real Hardware Testing** (Severity: HIGH)
   - Status: Only 1 device tested (Pi 4B), failed
   - Impact: Multi-platform support unverified
   - Risk: Code may not work on most claimed platforms

### Major Gaps
4. **No Interrupt Testing** (Severity: MEDIUM)
   - Impact: IRQ handling unvalidated
   - Risk: System may hang on hardware interrupts

5. **No Security Validation** (Severity: MEDIUM)
   - Impact: Secure boot claims unverified
   - Risk: Crypto code may be incorrect

6. **No Performance Testing** (Severity: LOW)
   - Impact: Boot time claims unverified
   - Unknown: Real-world performance characteristics

### AI-Generated Code Risks
7. **Untested AI Output** (Severity: MEDIUM)
   - ~70-80% of code is AI-generated
   - Most drivers never executed on real hardware
   - Assumptions may be incorrect
   - Edge cases likely missed

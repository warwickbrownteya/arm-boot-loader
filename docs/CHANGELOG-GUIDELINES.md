## Examples: Bad vs. Good

### Example 1: New Feature

❌ **BAD (Sales Language)**:
```
Implemented comprehensive SD card driver with FAT32 support!
Full filesystem access now available across all platforms.
Production-ready storage subsystem.
```

✅ **GOOD (Factual)**:
```
[ADD] SD card driver code and FAT32 parser

What changed:
- Added sd.c/h with EMMC initialization code
- Added fat.c/h with FAT32 parsing functions
- Added file reading functions

Status:
- What works: Code compiles
- What doesn't: EMMC init fails in QEMU
- What's untested: Real hardware, multi-card types

Evidence:
- Compilation: VERIFIED
- QEMU test: FAILS (no SD card detected)
- Hardware test: UNTESTED
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix

❌ **BAD**:
```
Fixed critical UART bug! Serial communication now rock-solid
and reliable. Full production deployment ready.
```

✅ **GOOD**:
```
[FIX] UART baud rate calculation for BCM2711

What changed:
- Corrected clock divisor formula in uart_init()
- Changed from 250MHz to 500MHz base clock for Pi 4

Status:
- What works: QEMU output improved
- What doesn't: Not tested on real Pi 4
- What's untested: Baud rates other than 115200

Evidence:
- QEMU: Characters now display correctly
- Hardware: UNTESTED
- Other rates: UNTESTED
```

### Example 3: Testing

❌ **BAD**:
```
Comprehensive testing validates bootloader excellence!
All subsystems thoroughly verified. Quality assured.
```

✅ **GOOD**:
```
[TEST] QEMU virt machine boot validation

What changed:
- Ran bootloader on QEMU virt (-M virt)
- Captured UART output
- Verified subsystem initialization

Status:
- What works: UART, Timer, Memory in QEMU virt
- What doesn't: SD card, GPIO (no QEMU support)
- What's untested: Real hardware, other QEMU machines

Evidence:
- QEMU virt boot: SUCCESS (see qemu_output.log)
- QEMU raspi3b: NOT ATTEMPTED
- Real hardware: NOT ATTEMPTED

Test coverage: ~20% of codebase (UART, Timer, Memory only)
```

### Example 4: Documentation

❌ **BAD**:
```
Created world-class documentation suite! Complete guides
covering every aspect. Professional-grade technical writing.
```

✅ **GOOD**:
```
[DOC] Added 28 markdown documentation files

What changed:
- Generated docs/ directory with 28 .md files
- Covers architecture, build, testing, APIs
- AI-generated based on codebase analysis

Status:
- What works: Files exist, build instructions accurate
- What doesn't: Some claims not verified (test coverage, platform support)
- What's untested: Accuracy against real hardware behavior

Evidence:
- Build instructions: VERIFIED (QEMU build works)
- Hardware instructions: UNTESTED
- API accuracy: NOT VALIDATED
- Status claims: SOME OPTIMISTIC (see SCORECARD.md)

Note: Documentation should be treated as preliminary
until validated against actual implementation behavior.
```

### Example 5: Failure

❌ **BAD** (Hiding):
```
Improved boot sequence initialization.
```

✅ **GOOD** (Honest):
```
[TEST] Pi 4B hardware boot test - FAILED

What changed:
- Copied bootloader.bin to SD card
- Attempted boot on Raspberry Pi 4B
- Connected UART to monitor serial output

Status:
- What works: NOTHING on real hardware
- What doesn't: No UART output, no boot progression
- What's untested: Whether CPU even starts

Evidence:
- UART output: NONE
- LED activity: NONE
- Power draw: Normal (board powered)

Root cause hypothesis:
1. Missing GPU firmware (bootcode.bin, start4.elf)
2. Wrong file naming (needs kernel8.img)
3. Missing config.txt
4. Possible memory layout issues

Next steps:
- Download official Raspberry Pi firmware
- Rename bootloader.bin to kernel8.img
- Create config.txt with proper settings
- Retest
```

## Language Guidelines

### Banned Promotional Terms

Avoid these in commits/PRs/changelogs:
- ❌ "Comprehensive" (unless you have metrics)
- ❌ "Production-ready" (unless extensively tested)
- ❌ "Fully tested" (unless coverage > 90%)
- ❌ "World-class" / "Best-in-class"

### Preferred Factual Terms

Use these instead:
- ✅ "Implemented [X]" → "Added code for [X] - compiles but untested"
- ✅ "Fixed [bug]" → "Modified [X] to address [Y] - verified in [environment]"
- ✅ "Tested" → "Tested on [platform] with [result] - see [evidence]"
- ✅ "Verified" → "Verified by [method] on [date] - [result]"
- ✅ "Working" → "Working in [environment] - [status in other environments]"
- ✅ "Documented" → "Documented in [file] - accuracy not validated"

## Balanced Scorecard Updates

Every significant change should update SCORECARD.md:

```markdown
### [Date] Update

**Changed Files:**
- [file1]: [change description]
- [file2]: [change description]

**Status Changes:**
- [Component]: [Old status] → [New status]
- Reason: [Factual explanation]
- Evidence: [How determined]

**New Metrics:**
- [Metric]: [Old value] → [New value]

**Test Results:**
- [Platform]: [Result with evidence]
```

---

## Summary: Core Principles

1. **Fact over Spin**: Describe what actually happened, not aspirations
2. **Evidence Required**: Claims need proof or disclaimer
3. **Disclose Failures**: Failed tests are valuable information
4. **Be Specific**: "Works in QEMU virt" not "works everywhere"
5. **Acknowledge Gaps**: "Untested" is better than assumed working
6. **No Hype**: Let the work speak for itself
7. **Metrics Matter**: Numbers > adjectives
8. **Balance**: Show strengths AND weaknesses

## Enforcement

### Self-Review Checklist

Before committing, ask:
- [ ] Are all claims factually accurate?
- [ ] Is test evidence provided or absence noted?
- [ ] Are limitations honestly disclosed?
- [ ] Did I avoid promotional language?
- [ ] Would I stake my reputation on these claims?
- [ ] If someone asked "how do you know?", can I answer?

### Tone Test

Read your commit message. Does it sound like:
- ❌ A product launch announcement?
- ❌ Marketing copy?
- ❌ A press release?
- ✅ A lab notebook entry?
- ✅ A scientific paper results section?
- ✅ An engineer's status report?

If it sounds promotional → rewrite factually.
